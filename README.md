# Random Quote Machine

A random quote is displayed, and the color of the elements change, each time the "New quote" button is clicked.
This is the first project for the Front End Development Librairies Certification of FreeCodeCamp.

## Live site

- Live Site URL: [GitHub Page](https://ax-cd.github.io/random-quote-machine/)

## Core technologies

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- Bootstrap
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

## Challenges I faced and things I learned

- fetch method : I had difficulty fetching the API, then realized it wasn't working because I forgot to add the json-server ; after that it was easy to display a new quote onClick.

- color shift : I liked the FCC Codepen - the color of the elements shift each time a new quote appears - and I wanted to implement it as well in my project.
